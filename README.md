Magic 8 Ball - Endpoint
CODE: This program magically answers a yes or no question with a funny response
Peer review by Daniel Decoito: The api and the program both run well. I like the use of haveing a variable be entered to make it 
appear as if your asking the console a question. Everything works well dont forget the gitinogre 

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in random/ *This is the name of the controller to target*
Then type in your yes or no quesition.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/random/{question}
